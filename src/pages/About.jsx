        `My name is Saad Khan, a name given to me by my father, Mohd Javed, on April 14, 2004, the day I was born in a small village in Sursanda, Uttar Pradesh, India. My family was overjoyed at my arrival, and as I grew up, so did my curiosity about the world around me. I was always fascinated by how small gadgets could perform complex tasks like connecting people and entertaining us. These little questions sparked my curiosity and fueled my passion for technology.`,
        `My academic journey began at Chandra Shekhar Azad College, Rasuli, where I completed my primary education. Later, I moved to Young Stream Academy for high school and intermediate studies. My teachers often praised me, especially my math teachers, who recognized my analytical mindset. I am particularly grateful to my math teacher, whose guidance deepened my love for mathematics. During my school years, I was introduced to coding and took my first steps into web development by learning HTML and CSS.`,
        `In 2022, I embarked on my tech career by enrolling in the Goel Group of Higher Studies, Mahavidyalaya, Lucknow, to pursue a Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA). This decision has been one of the best of my life. My college provided me with numerous opportunities to enhance my technical skills, and I was fortunate to learn from highly knowledgeable faculty members who were always willing to help us grow.`,
        `My journey into web development started with simple HTML & CSS projects, but my curiosity soon led me to explore JavaScript and backend technologies. During my second year, I discovered the power of MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js (MERN Stack)â€”and I was instantly hooked. Through various projects, I gained hands-on experience in building full-stack applications, working with APIs, and managing databases efficiently.`,
        `In my second year of college, I had the incredible opportunity to take an internship course at Coding Blocks. I am deeply grateful to my mentor, Mr. Subhanshu Gautam, who taught me the complete MERN stack and patiently helped me debug and refine my code whenever I faced challenges.`,
        `With my growing expertise in full-stack development, I took on the challenge of building my own MERN-based project, Shopify, in my second year. Additionally, I actively contributed to open-source projects, which further honed my problem-solving and teamwork skills. I am always eager to innovate and build something new.`,
        `As I continue to grow as a developer, I look forward to tackling challenging projects that push my skills even further. I am passionate about creating seamless web experiences and am always open to collaboration, learning, and innovation. Feel free to check out my projects and connect with me!`
